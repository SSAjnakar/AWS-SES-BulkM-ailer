# AWS-SES-BulkMailer


## Overview
The **AWS-SES-BulkMailer** is a Python application that allows users to send personalized emails to multiple recipients using AWS Simple Email Service (SES). It features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter, enabling users to easily manage contact and content files, configure email settings, and monitor the email sending process.

## Features
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organizes functionality into separate tabs for file selection, email configuration, and error logs.
- **File Management**: Supports CSV files for contacts and email content, allowing users to browse and select files easily.
- **Email Configuration**: Users can specify the sender's email and delay between sending emails.
- **Email Sending Process**: Emails are sent in the background to prevent freezing of the GUI.
- **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar and status messages keep users informed about the email sending process.
- **Log Generation**: Logs are created for each email sent, detailing the recipient and the status of the email.
